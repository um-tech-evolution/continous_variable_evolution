Notes on an approximate implementation of the Henrich 2004 model started on approximately Jan. 15, 2019

Plots in current nearly neutral paper:
Figure 8:  cont_var: attribute coef var as a function of N for various mutation_stddev  data/9_13_17
Figure 9:  inf_alleles:  neutral heterozygosity as a function of N for various mu  data/12_11_17
Figure 10: cont_var:  attribute coef var as a function of N for various N_mut  data/5_13_18
Figure 11: cont_var:  fitness differences as a function of N for NMut=1   data/1_17_18
Figure 12: cont_var:  Non-neutral fitness mean as a function of N for various values of Nmut

Note inconsistencies for N_mut (Fig 10), NMut (Fig 11), Nmut (Fig 12), NMut (paper).

We want to reproduce the results of Figures 8, 10, 11, 12.

We need to report attr_coef_var, fitness_mean, and fit_diffs for various N, and various NMut or mutation_stddev

We should have the option to renormalize fitnes on every generation.
